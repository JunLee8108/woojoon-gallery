      "Imagination of our future often gets to put into the margin between Utopia and Dystopia. I firmly believe that the key factor of dividing these two contrasting idea is an existence of individual freedom in the society, as we already experienced numerous historical tragedy as an outcome of absence of freedom under the authoritarian beliefs. Therefore, I imagine Utopia as a place where each individual’s idea to be placed in more accepted manner, where different ideas do not clash but harmonize with another instead.",

      "Buddhist idea of 極樂 (Guk-Lak) have two separated branch. First is 極樂淨土 (Guk-Lak-Jung-To), an idea that is similar to the Abraham branch religion’s heaven, where you must constantly work in order to achieve enlightenment to enter the heaven, while the other idea known as 唯心淨土 (Yu-Sim-Jung-To) suggests that heaven is already inside everyone’s heart, and we must get rid of all the greeds and worries and accept that our life itself already is a heaven. Throughout the history of mankind, humans have developed the society by sacrificing individual’s happiness in order to achieve each society’s perception of utopia. Perhaps in this time of rapid technological progress, we need to question ourselves if are these technological advancements are necessary to shape our society into a heaven.",

      "In Korea, toads often symbolize the wisdom, rich, and stability. And if you take a brief look at the history of Korea, it is full of continuous internal changes brought by the invaders from different countries due to its geographical location. And often times it was the common people who were suffered and sacrificed from these drastic changes within the society. Originally, Toad’s house is a traditional children’s song and play from Korea, where kids sing “Toad, Toad, I will give my old house, so give me a new house” while digging a tunnel in the ground. Perhaps this absurd lyrics represent my ancestor’s desire to live in a stability after facing numerous shifts.",

      "Ung-Nyeo is a character from the ancient Korean mythology, DanGun myth. In this ancient mythology, there were once a bear and a tiger went in a journey to find god(Ok-Hwang-Sang-Jeh) with a desire of becoming human. And after they met god, god gave them a test where both bear and tiger had to stay inside the cave just eating garlics and mugwort for 100 days, in return of granting their wish to become a human. At the end of the test, bear was the only one who succeeded the task, granted her wish to become a human and became the first queen of Korea. Recent discoveries from China recorded a war from the Manchurian region by the tribe who worships bears, and tribe who worships tiger. If you read the mythology once again, it suggests that tribe of bears represented by Ung Nyeo perhaps won from this war, and became the foundation of Korean people up to this date.",
